# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning classification models. The notebook walks through the full data science workflow including preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## üéØ Objective

To build and evaluate classification models that predict wine quality based on features such as acidity, sugar content, pH level, and alcohol percentage.

## üîç Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Loaded the wine dataset using `pandas`
   - Explored feature distributions and summary statistics

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Checked for and handled missing values
   - Converted wine quality into binary or multiclass labels (if needed)
   - Scaled/normalized features for better model performance

3. **Model Building**
   - Used various classification algorithms including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forests
   - Split data into training and testing sets

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated models using:
     - Accuracy
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
   - Compared performance across models

5. **Visualization**
   - Visualized feature importance
   - Plotted model performance metrics
